# ✨ VibeBuilder

**Build your dream web app in seconds with AI.**

VibeBuilder V2 is an open-source, agentic AI web builder that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents to research, plan, code, test, and debug modern web applications from a single text prompt. Powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: A coordinated team of 5 AI agents (Researcher, Architect, Coder, Tester, Debugger) working in unison.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration**: Blazing fast inference for real-time application building.
- **Web Researcher**: Grounded in real-time data using Google Search to find current design trends and requirements.
- **Live Preview**: Instantly render and interact with your generated app in a secure sandbox.
- **Streaming UI**: Watch the AI "think" and build in real-time with a typewriter effect interaction.
- **Refinement Loop**: Chat with the AI to tweak designs, fix bugs, or add new features instantly.
- **Professional UI**: A "Lovable" / "Replit" inspired clean, dark/light mode interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a **Flask** backend to manage the agent orchestration and a vanilla **HTML/JS** frontend for a fast, build-free developer experience.
